ElementEndow Library - Developer Documentation

ElementEndow is a mod that adds an elemental attribute and reaction system to Minecraft. It has now been refactored into a library mod, enabling other developers to easily create extensions or integrate the elemental system into their own mods.

You can add and modify elements in the config/element_endow_elements.properties file.

Element Endow Configuration Add elements in format: modid:element_name elements=

Registered elements will automatically register corresponding attributes. Use the /attribute command in-game to query them.

The mod automatically adds registered elemental attributes to players and living entities. You can freely modify and test these attributes on such entities.

You can read the mod's wiki.
